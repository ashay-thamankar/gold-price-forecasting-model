# Gold Price Time Series Prediction

## Problem Statement
🎯 The goal of this project is to forecast gold prices accurately using time series analysis techniques. By leveraging historical gold price data, we aim to provide insights and predictions to assist investors and stakeholders in making informed decisions.

## About Dataset
📊 The dataset contains historical gold price data from January 1950 to July 2020, comprising the 'Date' and 'Price' columns. This dataset enables us to analyze trends, patterns, and fluctuations in gold prices over time.

## Analysis
🔍 - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and trends in gold prices over different time periods.
- Examined quarterly, yearly, and monthly average gold prices to identify seasonal patterns and long-term trends.
- Utilized various visualization techniques such as line charts, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize and interpret the data.

## Model Used
📈 - Implemented various time series forecasting models including Simple Exponential Smoothing, Linear Regression, and Exponential Smoothing to predict future gold prices.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Explanation
🔧 - The project demonstrates the application of time series analysis techniques to predict gold prices accurately.
- Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection, we create robust forecasting models capable of capturing the underlying patterns in the data.

## Usage
🚀 To run the project, clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/ashay-thamankar/gold-price-forecasting-model.git) and set up the 'gold' environment using the provided requirements file.

- Copy and paste the following commands into your command prompt or terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashay-thamankar/gold-price-forecasting-model.git
cd gold-price-forecasting-model
conda activate gold
```
